The projects listed here are Python codes I have written between March 2020 and September 2020. The source code's style may not
be the most mature, but it works. My understanding of good programming practices has increased a lot since then.

ClickIntensity: 
- A detailed instruction pdf for ClickIntensity can be found here: https://1drv.ms/b/s!AkQWSMjJWJr1gophVl1ftyjxgOau7g?e=CNf6Rq
- Brief description: You click somewhere on the image, it will automatically generate a circle, and compute the average pixel intensity
within that circle. You can just keep clicking and all those pixel intensity data gets automatically stored in an excel sheet.
 -Notable features:
    1. Adjustable circle radius
    2. Adjustable display brightness (exposure/curve)
    3. Zoom/pan display
    4. Pair mode for two-channel colocalization analysis
    5. Annotated image for data visualization
