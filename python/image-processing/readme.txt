The projects listed here are Python codes I have written between March 2020 and September 2020. The source code's style may not
be the most mature, but it works. My understanding of good programming practices has increased a lot since then.

ClickIntensity: 
A detailed instruction pdf for ClickIntensity can be found here: https://1drv.ms/b/s!AkQWSMjJWJr1gophVl1ftyjxgOau7g?e=CNf6Rq
Brief description: A tool to aid fluorescent image analysis. User open the image to be analysed using this application, and
then they will able to generate circular ROIs (region of interest) on the desired parts of the image, each with a single click.
The average pixel intensity within those ROIs will be automatically computed and wrote to an excel spreadsheet. Overall, this
is much easier compared to the traditional process in ImageJ which requires users to manually drag and create every single circle.
ClickIntensity V4 also allows users to adjust ROI radii, adjust display brightness, and zooming in/out.
Small note: though I wrote this script as a project in Trcek Lab @ Johns Hopkins University, it was actually also largely 
inspired by my own personal experiences with ImageJ and fluorescent image analysis when I was a summer intern at Bradham Lab at
Boston University. Basically, knowing the cumbersomeness of the ROI-based image analysis from my experience at Bradham lab
makes me more motivated in pursuing this project.
