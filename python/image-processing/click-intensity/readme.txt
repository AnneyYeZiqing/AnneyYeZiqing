ClickIntensity
By Ziqing Ye @ Trcek lab


The program is used to take pixel intensity data. Here’s a brief summary of what it does: 
a.	You open the program and the image that you want to analyze opens up.
b.	You left click somewhere on the image
c.	A circle with a customized radius is generated there. It has a number on it.
a)	While the program is running, you can change the display brightness, zoom in and out, as well as adjust the radius of your circle
d.	The average* pixel intensity within that circle is calculated.
e.	This intensity information is saved into an excel spreadsheet
f.	You click somewhere else, and step b-e are repeated.
g.	Once you are done, you press esc to close the image.
h.	When you close it, the image with all those circles is saved to your folder for future reference， along with an excel spreadsheet that stores all of the pixel intensity data.
Some notable features:
1.	Can easily adjust the display brightness for seeing dimmer signals without causing fluctuations in the recorded intensity data
2.	Can freely adjust the radius of circular ROIs (region of interest) depending on the sample conditions
3.	Can zoom in and out and recenter while making accurate ROI selections.
